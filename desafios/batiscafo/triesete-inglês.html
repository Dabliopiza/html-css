        <p>In 1960, <strong>Jacques Piccard</strong> and <strong>Don Walsh</strong> piloted the <strong>Trieste</strong> during the dive to the deepest point on Earth, the <strong> Challenger Deep</strong>, located at 10,916 meters deep.</p>
        <br>
 
        <p>The <strong>Philippines Sea</strong>was rough on this morning of January 23, 1960, making it extremely difficult to launch the US Navy's bathyscaphe Trieste into the abyssal region.</p>
        <br>
 
        <p>However, once started, the deepest dive in human history was actually quite tedious, according to <strong>Don Walsh</strong>. The 28-year-old US Navy lieutenant piloted Trieste alongside Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard during the nine-hour dive to the deepest point on the planet, Challenger Deep, about 200 miles southwest of the island of Guam, in Mariana Trench. But the boredom was interrupted by a moment of sheer terror, adds Walsh.</p>
        <br>
 
        <p>They had already covered two-thirds of the way to the bottom when they heard a crash from the hull of the small autonomous bathyscaphe. <strong>Walsh</strong> and Piccard exchanged a furtive look, already preparing for the end. But nothing happened. “It was just that loud noise, a kind of explosion, and nothing else,” says Walsh.</p>

         <p>Later, they learned that an external Plexiglas window had cracked at a pressure that, according to the pair's measurements, was a ton per square centimeter – almost a thousand times greater than that of the surface. The cracked window “didn't pose a vital risk, at least not right away,” says Walsh, shrugging.</p>
         <br>
  
         <p>The Trieste dive was more than a new exploratory record. With it, Piccard and Walsh opened a scientific window to the ocean floor, hitherto widely regarded as devoid of life. Upon reaching the bottom, the pair used mercury vapor lamps to explore their surroundings, shrouded in complete darkness, and were surprised by what they saw. “Without a doubt, the most interesting find was a flatfish that we could see through the hatch, trying to hide itself in the ocean floor,” Piccard later said. "We were impressed to find more developed marine life forms deep down."

        <br>

        <p>Today, scientists continue to study the extraordinarily complex ecosystem of the ocean's abysmal depths, made up of hundreds of species of foraminifera – single-celled organisms with a shell – that make up more than half of all living matter and make up the closest link to the beginning of the ocean food chain. In the Challenger Deep mud, scientists have found more than 400 species whose DNA resembles some of the earliest life forms on Earth.</p>
        <br>
 
         <p>Jacques Piccard, who died in 2008, spent the rest of his life exploring the underwater world – of which he was one of the pioneers – later building four mesoscafos (mid-depth submarines).</p>
         <br>
 
         <p>Don Walsh, who commanded Trieste, became a US Navy submarine commander and one of the most eminent oceanographers in the world. It also carried out more than 50 expeditions to the polar regions and continued to explore the depths of the ocean.</p>
         <br>
 
         <p>Walsh continues to roam the seas two or three months a year, mainly to share his vision of the state of the oceans with policy makers and citizens alike. Concerned, he warns that the threats (acidification, overfishing and oxygen loss due to global climate change) are increasing, while the study and defense of the oceans lack resources.</p>
         <br>
 
         
 
         <p>“Scientists have done an excellent job in the oceans,” he continues. “The problem is that it's still not enough. I often call oceanography a 'great science', as it takes ships, infrastructure, a lot of time and immense resources to study these processes in greater depth. But we must remember what is at stake: nothing less than the future of the planet we live on!”</p>
         <br>
 
         <p>An Oscar winner for best director, James Cameron is also the explorer who, on March 26, 2012, 52 years after Trieste, reached the Challenger Depression aboard a submersible specially designed for the expedition. It was the first solo dive to the deepest part of the ocean.</p>
